# WebDev-ResourcesApp
This is my first Full Stack App using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODEJS, MONGOOSE and MONGODB

## My Story on becoming a Web Developer
My name is Mauricio Sarmiento and I recently moved to Seattle. When I arrived to Seattle I started to be interested in Web Development and decided to teach myself how to code. This journey was not easy and I thought I could share with you valuable resources I used to learn.

## What does this website offer?
When I first started coding, I faced the problem any newbie faces, there are a lot of resources out there and as a newcomers we don't know what resources are good, should I pay or not, am I learning the right thing, etc. That's why this website can help you check the resources I used to teach myself how to code. You can also upload other resources you use, only create a username and start posting.

> NOTE: 
  > The app is not ready, right now it has all the functionality when used locally but for security reasons i wont be letting people use the sign up / sig in / upload blogs and create comments. The resources I have used will be added slowly because my main goal with this app was to be able to build it more than using it, but eventually people will be able to use it.
