# WebDev-ResourcesApp
This is my first Full Stack App using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODEJS, MONGOOSE and MONGODB. If you like what you see and would like to give the app a test please message me so I can give you the admin code, I am not letting anyone post here for security reasons and for people not to upload things not related to the purpose of this app.

Thank you for understanding! :)

## My Story on becoming a Web Developer
My name is Mauricio Sarmiento and I recently moved to Seattle. When I arrived to Seattle I started to be interested in Web Development and decided to teach myself how to code. This journey was not easy and I thought I could share with you valuable resources I used to learn.

## What does this website offer?
When I first started coding, I faced the problem any newbie faces, there are a lot of resources out there and as a newcomers we don't know what resources are good, should I pay or not, am I learning the right thing, etc. That's why this website can help you check the resources I used to teach myself how to code. You can also upload other resources you use, only create a username and start posting.

> NOTE: 
  > Right now it has all the functionality. The resources I have used will be added slowly because my main goal with this app was to be able to build it more than using it, but eventually people will be able to use it.
